plot(x)   -->
	default color is blue (left), red (right) for audio,
	default color is dark green, margenta (for imaginary part of a complex signal) for non-audio

plot(x,(color_marker_styles))	-->
	color : one of ymcrgbwk
	marker : one of o+*.xsd^v<>ph
	linestyle: one of - -- : :. 
	the order doesn't matter
	Specified color applies both to line and marker (if you want a different color for marker, call set() later)
	If marker is specified but linestyle is not, no line
	If color is specified and marker is not, solid line ("-")
	(in other words, unspecified linestyle means 
		no line if marker is specified
		solid if marker is not specified)

	for example
plot(x, "m-")	// default setting, margenta, solid line
plot(x, "-")	// default setting, margenta, solid line
plot(x, "*")	// default line color, marker *, no line
plot(x, "c")	// cyan, solid line
plot(x,"bo") 	// blue, o, no line
plot(x,"bo--") 	// blue, o, dashed line
plot(x,"ob") 	// blue, o, no line
plot(x,"o:b") 	// blue, o, dotted
